Maestro
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dantleech/maestro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dantleech/maestro)

**This project is still in an experimental phase and has not been used to  orchestrate anything at this stage**

Maestro will be a package orchestration and management tool.

Use it, for many packages in parallel, to (for example):

- Apply file templates.
- Run scripts.
- Gather version information
- Generate reports.

In the future it is hoped that it will:

- Automate releases.
